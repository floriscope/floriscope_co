## FLORISCOPE WEB v2

This repo is a complete rewrite based on React v16 / Redux for Floriscope webapp.

This project uses some awesome depedencies such [react-router-v4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for routing, styled-components-like [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion), [Rebass](jxnblk.com/rebass/) and [styled-system](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system) for styling and the almighty [Redux](redux.js.org/) with [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk
), [redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) and [redux-form](https://redux-form.com/) for state management.
This app can actually be wired with RESTfull API endpoints, but also with [GraphQL](http://graphql.org) API via [Apollo Client v1.4](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client)
