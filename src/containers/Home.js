      Westeros is Poorly Designed Bring It. UPDATE 1: You found me, Internet!
      It’s great to have you on my blog! Boy, Game of Thrones really has an SEO
      cachet that demographic analysis does not usually command. So, a few
      notes. 1. I read all comments, reply as I am able. 2. Yes, that means you
      too, Reddit and MetaFilter commenters. 3. I’ve answered some common
      critiques here. 4. If you like this level of nerdiness, I do it regularly
      analyzing actual historic demographics on my Podcast. Check it out! UPDATE
      2: Also! By popular demand from my fellow uber-nerds, I’ve written up my
      thoughts on plausible Medieval population geography. I invite comment and
      critique of these estimates, and will revise them as appropriate. UPDATE
      3: Some folks over at Reddit got into it recently about the size of
      Westeros, and this map started circulating, and then I was looped into it
      and got asked if it was plausible. Answer: yes, I think this is probably a
      pretty plausible map of the known parts of Planetos: Update 4: I’ve
      written a more recent piece discussing the possibility of an industrial
      revolution in Planetos, why it may/may not happen, and where it will
      happen if it does. Aside from being a migration nerd, I’m also a
      general-purpose nerd nerd, and a hobbyist world-builder. Yes, hobbyist
      world-building is a thing. But because I’m both kinds of nerd here, I’m
      the guy who reads Lord of the Rings and is perpetually bothered by the
      ridiculous economic models being presented. Like, really? Everything
      between the Shire and Rohan is depopulated save for a few ruins here and
      there? Did the land just up and stop yielding harvests or something? Sure.
      Okay. That’s some plausible economic geography. But in most cases, the
      obvious demographic and economic illiteracy of an author is totally
      forgivable because they’re not making any claims to realism. I don’t
      trouble over the absurdly small scale of warfare in Star Wars compared to
      the size of the galactic population and economy because, um, if I wanted
      realism I wouldn’t be watching Star Wars. There is an exception to my
      forgiveness: Game of Thrones, or, if you prefer, A Song of Ice and Fire.
      This setting is often held up for its “gritty realism.” Now of course
      there is magic at work here; you don’t get dragons and a
      gazillion-foot-tall wall of ice without some kind of breach of realism.
      And I’m fine with all of that. But what I’m not fine with is the
      ridiculous demographic illiteracy of Westeros. So I’m now gonna play
      party-pooper on Westeros. I exclude Essos because (1) there’s way less
      available information and (2) such information as does exist indicates if
      anything an even more preposterously unbelievable setting. How Big Is
      Westeros? A Moderate Continent Here are three visual references I found
      for the size of Westeros: Left, middle, right. In case you’re wondering,
      no, those pictures do not all indicate the same sized continent. I hasten
      to add, of course, that when I say “Westeros” henceforth, I really mean
      the Seven Kingdoms. I won’t get into anything Beyond The Wall. Okay then:
      Westeros is pretty big. George RR Martin (henceforth GRRM) has compared
      Westeros to South America in size. Looking at the map above, it’s clearly
      smaller in land area than the European Union, though not much smaller. But
      this is weird. South America is about 6.9 million square miles. The
      European Union is about 1.7 million square miles. So we have a very big
      problem already, the author doesn’t seem to have any idea how large his
      world is. Whoopsie. Turns out, some valiant readers have come up with an
      estimate of about 3.6 million square miles. I’ll use 3.6 million square
      miles as my baseline estimate, but will also calibrate all major results
      with a 1.6 million square mile figure, and a 6.9 million square mile
      figure. It is important that we begin with the size of Westeros! First of
      all, this should be one of the easier things to get a handle on since it
      (1) is fixed, (2) is often directly or indirectly referenced in the book
      and show due to character travels, (3) is often presented in maps. Of
      course, we’re also told that the maps aren’t strictly accurate and really
      represent Westerosi impressions of area, and the characters (books and
      show) do seem to have an amazing ability to disregard the physical laws of
      travel. But nonetheless, these geographic constraints remain much more
      fixed and determinable than direct population estimates. How Big Are
      Armies? Actually, It Doesn’t Matter Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire
      nerds (henceforth just “Game of Thrones” or “GoT”) obsess about military
      mobilization rates. On its face value, this makes sense. GRRM gives us
      lots of information about army sizes. We routinely get figures referring
      to thousands of soldiers, and there seems like a real concern that we know
      who has more men or less men. Fans then take these figures, apply a
      reasonable “mobilization rate,” and extrapolate to a population. Here’s an
      example. This method, however, is bullcrap. There are two major reasons
      why the “start from armies” approach will systematically mislead readers:
      Military Mobilization Varies Widely- Some very silly readers assert a
      0.5%-1% military mobilization rate is appropriate because early-modern
      France only fielded 1–3% as its army, so Medieval France should be lower.
      This is silly. Medieval armies are not standing forces. You can field a
      vastly larger temporary force than a permanent force, especially if it’s a
      temporary and nonprofessional force. There are some references in the book
      and show, but it seems clear that many of the fighters in GoT armies are
      not full-time professional soldiers. In other words, we should expect very
      large annual, seasonal, and event-based variation in mobilization rates.
      It’s not unreasonable to think a city under siege could have a 10–20%
      mobilization rate. It’s also not unreasonable to think that many polities
      would only be able to field 0.2% or 0.3% of their population for
      harvest-season offensive warfare in an unpopular war. So to extrapolate
      population from army size, you need a vast amount of information about
      cultural norms, agriculture, offense/defense balance, professionalization
      of armies, etc. We don’t have that information. GRRM Messed Up His Army
      Sizes- Westeros is allegedly based on Medieval Europe. You wouldn’t know
      it from the army sizes. We’ve seen or heard about dozens of battles with
      20,000, 30,000, 40,000, or more combatants, sometimes that many on each
      side. For comparison, the historically decisive Battle of Agincourt
      probably had under 30,000 soldiers. The Battle of Hastings had 25,000 at
      most. The incredibly vast Battle of Tours, where Charles Martel turned
      back the Arab advance, may have had 60,000 combatants. But crucially:
      these battles were decades or hundreds of years apart, rarely involving
      the same armies. The Battle of Yarmouk, after which the Caliphate siezed
      the entire Byzantine East, had just 50,000 fighters or so, with the result
      that the Caliphate conquered the entire region. Crucially, it should be
      noted that contemporaries gave much higher numbers: the Byzantines were
      routinely asserted to be fielding 100,000 men, while Muslims were depicted
      as leading hundreds of thousands. Conveniently, the sum total of GRRM’s
      descriptions of armies would suggest that Westeros can field between
      200,000 and 650,000 soldiers, depending on conditions. Those numbers are
      almost certainly too large, with too robust an ability to recover losses.
      Medieval armies were small, except in cases where they were extremely
      professionalized, like the Byzantine armies, or Charles Martel’s Frankish
      army. Holding a Medieval army together was very hard, as was supplying it.
      The frequency with which there are large armies in Westeros is just
      ridiculous. The most reasonable explanation is that GRRM is an unreliable
      narrator, as he is for land area: these armies probably are not as big as
      he claims in many cases, and losses probably are not as steep. All this to
      say, we should not try to extrapolate total population from the size of
      armies during a time of crisis and volatility, especially given that those
      army size numbers seem unreliable. How Big Are the Cities? Smaller Than
      People Think King’s Landing does not have 500,000 residents. GRRM has
      stated that the city is larger than Medieval London or Paris, but smaller
      than Constantinople or ancient Rome. The GoT wiki suggests Medieval
      Constantinople had a million residents. To which I say:
      buuuuuuuuuuulllllsh*******t. Its actual population was almost certainly
      never above 400,000 after the 700s, more frequently around 200,000. The
      million-resident estimates are bogus as can be, or else must reflect only
      unique circumstances like “all of Thrace fled behind the walls during a
      siege.” Meanwhile, medieval London had maximum 100,000 residents, but
      50,000 is more likely. Paris had maximum 300,000. In other words, GRRM
      seems to have a loose grasp at best of the size of Medieval urban
      populations, but, crucially, none of his figures give a plausible reason
      to think King’s Landing has 500,000 residents (statements of characters in
      the book be darned!). Rule of thumb, all your city population ideas,
      chop’em in half. Never trust pre-modern population estimates! They’re
      always always wrong, and always inflated! Unless you have a list of names
      and addresses, don’t trust it! And recall that GRRM is a consciously
      unreliable narrator, and his characters are highly motivated. So from
      here, we can make some guesses. Most estimates put King’s Landing at
      500,000, Oldtown just below it (say 450,000), Lannisport below that
      (300,000), then Gulltown (50,000), then White Harbor (40,000). Let’s chop
      that in half: so instead of 1,340,000 in our top 5 cities, we’ve now got
      670,000 in our Top 5 Cities. Now let’s assume other towns have that much
      population again. This is reasonable, as in most societies the number of
      smaller towns and cities is much greater than the number of larger towns
      and cities. So probably our total urban population is 1–1.5 million. Now
      we can pick an urbanization rate. Probably a high-end guess would be
      similar to the Byzantine Empire or Italy, so about 10–15%. A low-end guess
      would be more like northern and western Europe, so 3–6%. But while GRRM
      says Westeros is like Western Europe, this major urban cluster with a
      centralized Imperial-style monarchy would seem more Byzantine. If we
      assume that, despite remarkably vast urban centers, Westeros is the most
      rural part of Europe, then we get a total population of about 42 million
      people. On the other hand, if we assume (as I think more plausible) that
      Westeros is more like the more urbanized parts of Europe, then we get a
      total population of just 11 million. So based on some simple math from the
      size of urban centers, the population of Westeros ranges from 11 million
      to 42 million people. But we can do better than that. How Dense is
      Westeros? The Great Debate of Medieval Demography Everybody who does any
      medieval demography has seen the “Medieval Demographics Made Easy”
      website. It’s a neat resource. Unfortunately, it may be overestimating the
      density of Medieval populations. For example, that site suggests that a
      realm with horribly bad climate and a Mad King (so, Westeros) should have
      about 30 people per square mile. That gives us a range of 48 million to
      207 million Westerosians, depending on the size of the continent. If it’s
      EU-sized, then this allegedly “very low density” gives us 48 million
      people, which corresponds neatly to my “low urbanization” estimate. But if
      the continent actually is as big as most fans estimate (3.6 million square
      miles), then we get 108 million residents of Westeros. And if it’s as big
      as GRRM estimates, we get 207 million residents! These numbers of crazy.
      The modern population of South America is just 380 million people. And
      that’s with numerous cities that have tens of millions of people. Now if
      we compare to the European Union with 500 million residents, the 48
      million sounds fairly plausible: Westeros might well have 1/10th the
      density of modern Europe. Buuuuut. Wait a second. Maybe the Medieval
      Demographics Made Easy missed something. Maybe densities can go lower.
      Yes, densities can go lower, way lower. It turns out, the Byzantine
      Empire, one of the most urbanized parts of Europe, had typical population
      densities of between 18 and 25 people per square mile. How ‘bout dem
      apples. If we use 20 people per square mile as our estimate, then the
      EU-area estimate yields 32 million people, fan-calculations yield 72
      million, and GRRM’s South America comment yields 138 million people. But,
      to reiterate, we are bounded by our urbanization-population estimates: a
      population estimate over 54 million is going to imply either (1) we
      believe implausible and contradictory things about the size of medieval
      cities or (2) we believe that Westeros is substantially more rural than
      Medieval Europe, despite having much larger cities. And this is where you
      hit your problem. What is Westeros Really Like? GRRM Wants Too Many
      Things — So Do His Fans If the Seven Kingdoms are Medieval Europe, then
      their degree of urbanization is comically overblown. On the other hand, if
      they’re as urban as we are to believe, then it’s extremely unlikely that
      we’re looking at a truly “Medieval” society. Consider this: if the urban
      population is what GRRM seems to indicate (probably about 2–2.5 urban and
      town dwellers total), but urbanization rates are near western Medieval
      levels, then the Seven Kingdoms likely have 48 million residents… which is
      just about half the Fan-Area-Estimate-With-Higher-Density population
      figure of 108 million. But if that’s true, we have another problem. We’ve
      got 100 million people in an area the size of the United States…and there
      are basically just 4 ethnicities. Here’s one fan’s map of Westerosi
      ethnicity: Source. Green is the First Men, red is the Andals, blue the
      Rhoynar, and yellow the Valyrians. Now it should be noted, there’s debate
      about whether those southern First Men are actually First Men, or some
      other group. So maybe we’ve got 5 ethnicities. That’s ridiculous. Let me
      say it again: that’s ridiculous. It is not reasonable, nay, it is not even
      hypothetically possible, in an age before mass communication and easy
      travel, that groups across such vast geographic distances would have so
      little genetic and linguistic differences. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. Why?
      Simple. In pre-modern societies, most people didn’t migrate. Ever. Most
      people didn’t really ever even travel, unless they were recruited for war.
      In other words, genetics traits tended to be geographically more
      concentrated than they are today. Likewise, linguistic traits were tightly
      concentrated. Now, here’s a map of modern European languages, in an area
      smaller than the fan-preferred estimate of Westeros’ size: Whoops! Tons of
      different language groups! And that map is clearly super-simplified. It
      excludes many minority modern languages. And it turns out, language was
      even more diverse back before we had modern mass communication. Remember
      all of Shakespeare’s weird spellings? Yeah, pronunciation was weird too!
      “French” and “German” and “Italian” did not exist as they do today. So
      here’s a map of local languages in Iberia and France: Source. Huzzah! In
      an area the size of Dorne, we have at least 10 major dialect groups from
      at least 2 totally different language families, and literally dozens of
      local dialects. And keep in mind, the different color shades represent
      languages sufficiently different that immediate inter-intelligibility was
      unlikely. That is to say, a person from southern France had to learn
      northern French. Sure, not as hard as learning Saxon, but not just a
      question of learning the accent and a few slang words. All of that to say,
      Westeros is incredibly un-diverse. Because Westeros isn’t a continent.
      Westeros is Britain, blown up on giant scale. And that is the key problem:
      GRRM and his fans want a boundless British Medieval Fantasyland. Essos is
      segregated from Westeros by a sea that is geographically narrow, but
      culturally vast; the plot, characters, cultures, language, all of it
      varies across this channel far more than any reasonable historical process
      would seem to justify, with Essos incredibly diverse, and Westeros
      incredibly not. Why is this? Simple: world-builders tend to build mirrors
      of their own minds in one way or another. For GRRM, this appears to mean
      exploring an undiverse world killing each other while a looming threat of
      external diversity rises up to destroy the unsuspecting white people.
      Whoops. For all the climate-change analogies, “immigrants will kill us
      all” is a way easier explanation of the twin threats beyond the wall and
      across the Narrow Sea. Why Diversity Matters for World-Building Westerosi
      Political Conflict Is Far Too Simple GoT is often held up as having very
      complicated or intricate political intrigue. This is very silly. We’re
      dealing with a very homogenous world with few major threats. How can I say
      this? Simple: it’s far too easy to control. Consider the Targaryen
      dynasty. They lasted 283 years on the Iron Throne, with 17 rules, for an
      average of 17 years of reign per ruler. That is incredibly implausible,
      even with fire-breathing dragons. Consider the Roman Empire, a similarly
      vast political entity: no dynasty ever lasted more than 15 rulers, and no
      direct descendant dynasty lasted more than eight rulers. The longest-lived
      dynasty were either the Julio-Claudians or the Nerva-Antonines, both of
      whom used adoption extensively, neither of whom lasted even 100 years. But
      their average reigns were 19 and 14 years, so that makes 17-year-average
      sound reasonable. Except that the average reign length across all Roman
      rulers who lasted at least 1 year was… about 9 years. Consider the
      Byzantine Empire. Of the 5 major dynasties that lasted more than 50 years,
      just 2 lasted more than 100 years. Now the Byzantine Emperors were more
      long-lived among the dynasties I counted: about 12-year average reigns,
      but, as I did for the Romans, I exclude the frequent crises where they
      burn through multiple emperors in a short span of time, or have
      non-dynastic emperors. Or consider a group very like the Targaryens: the
      Mongols. Like the Targaryens, they were an ethnically foreign
      conquest-dynasty arriving with uniquely powerful weapons that, after they
      acculturated to the new place, eventually decayed. The united Mongol
      Empire lasted for 4 rulers realistically, 6 in nominal terms. Individual
      Khanates lasted longer, but the point is that in realistic political
      struggles, long dynasties are incredibly rare. The founding dynasty of the
      Holy Roman Empire lasted just 6 rulers, and there was only one
      double-digit dynasty ever. We see the same thing with the rise of Robert
      Baratheon. What, he can just beat the Targaryens and that makes him King?
      Psh, yeah right. That’s incredibly silly. That’s not how feudalism works.
      In the truly dynamic setting of a truly Medieval society spanning an
      entire continent, the end of the Targaryens would be the end of a united
      Westeros. Now real fans may say, “But that is what we’re seeing! The end
      of a united Westeros!” maybe, but it makes little sense that it came after
      the death of Robert Baratheon, instead of after the end of the Targaryens
      monarchy. Make Westeros Realistic (Again?) Some Proposed Parameters Now
      let’s do an “If I had done it” style thing. It’s easy to criticize, harder
      to solve. So let’s do some solving. Here are our constraints to maintain
      realism: Large settings must have increasing amounts of diversity Urban
      community sizes must be within plausible boundaries Exceptionally large
      urban communities should not, in general, be accompanied by very low
      overall urbanization Densities, however, can plausibly be anywhere from
      20–40 people per square mile Let’s try and fill in these parameters.
      Diversity- Very low. This implies a small setting. Urban communities-
      Larger than in historic Europe. Urbanization- No direct estimate. But
      given #2, presumably fairly high. Density- No direct estimate, but outside
      of the North, we do seem to have a pretty darn densely settled continent.
      So let’s get some estimates: 2. Urban Population- 1.25 million 3.
      Urbanization- 6% 4. Density- 30 people per square mile The implied land
      area of Westeros is… 700,000 square miles. Whoops! But, hold on. As silly
      as that sounds, it would solve some other problems. For one thing, we’d be
      able to explain why there’s so little diversity: Westeros isn’t even close
      to as large as has previously been asserted. We can also explain the
      unusual dynastic length! A key reason for short-lived dynasty is that
      diffuse populations are hard to control, and large empires enable frontier
      commanders to create political constituencies to advance their own
      rulership. But if Westeros is much smaller than we estimated, if in fact
      the whole continent is only about the size of the Byzantine Empire, then
      the stability of the Targaryens is easier to explain. And lest you think,
      “But that’s too small for the complexity of intrigue!” recall that, hello,
      byzantine as an adjective is actually synonymous with clever intrigue.
      Now, this estimate does totally disregard the physical distances outlined
      in the text, and categorically eliminates the possibility of GRRM as a
      reliable source about his own setting. But on that note, let’s, for a
      moment, see what happens if we assume Westeros really is the size of South
      America. And, after that, I will finally walk you through a systematic
      process to estimate the population of Westeros.
